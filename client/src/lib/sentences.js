//   `Astronomers have captured some of the most detailed images ever seen of galaxies in deep space.`,

//   `They are in much higher definition than normal and reveal the inner workings of galaxies in unprecedented detail.`,

//   `Many of the images could yield insights into the role of black holes in star and planet formation.`,

//   `The researchers say that the pictures will transform our understanding of how galaxies evolve.`,

//   `The images are of the radio waves emitted by the galaxies. Researchers often study the radio waves from astronomical objects rather than the visible light they give off because it enables them to see things that would otherwise be blocked by the Earths atmosphere or dust and gas in faraway galaxies.`,

//   `Many regions of space that are dark to our eyes, actually burn brightly in the radio waves they give off. This allows astronomers to peer into star-forming regions or into the heart of galaxies.`,

//   `What is new is that the team has dramatically improved the resolution of radio images by linking together more than 70,000 small antennae spread across nine European counties.
//   The radio signals have been captured by 70,000 one-metre-high antennas across nine European countries`,

//   `The accomplishment is a technical tour de force and was led by Dr Leah Morabito from Durham University, UK.`,

//   `To work on the data for so long, and then to finally get such images and be able be the first person to see what it looks like is just incredible, she told BBC News.`,

//   `I walked around with a huge smile on my face for the rest of the day, because I felt so proud that I was able to make these images and be able to see something nobody had ever seen before.`,

//   `The image at the top of the page was produced by a member of Dr Morabitos team. It shows a galaxy that is barely visible, sitting in the middle of jets of material in orange, shooting out from either side, each one much larger than the galaxy itself.`,

//   `The jets are caused by a supermassive black hole at the heart of the galaxy- an object with such strong gravity not even light can escape. It normally sucks in material - but the inward pull also creates forces around the black hole that result in material being spat out, far into space.`,

//   `The picture above shows two galaxies colliding. the bright spot on the one on the left is caused by exploding stars - creating what is effectively a galactic wind - blowing dust and gas away from it.`,

//   `The images are revealing that galaxies are much more than a collection of stars. They are dynamic sun- and planet-making factories, powered by black holes, according to Dr Neal Jackson, from the University of Manchester.`,

//   `Even seasoned astronomers go wow! when they see these images, he told me.`,

//   `Its become very clear that, in order to understand galaxy evolution, we need to understand the black hole right at the very centre, because it appears to have a fairly fundamental influence on how galaxies evolve and that is what these images allow us to do, says Dr Jackson.`,

//   `These high-resolution images allow us to zoom in to see whats really going on when supermassive black holes launch these jets of material.`,

//   `Dr Morabito says that images like these are helping astronomers learn just how these processes, that created stars and planets - including our own Solar System - actually work.`,

//   `We are really beginning to understand how galaxies have evolved. And the black holes are a massive part of that because their jets can take away fuel for star formation. And as they push outwards, they can disrupt the galaxies. They can even trigger star formation or quench it and make it happen less, she said.`,

//   `The first set of results have led to the publication of nine scientific papers on the dynamics of black holes in galaxies. But this is just the start for the team. They plan to scan millions of galaxies over the next few years.`,

//   `And thats really what we need to be able to understand, the whole complete picture of how black holes impact galaxy evolution, says Dr Morabito,`,

//   `I think were definitely in for some surprises. Whenever you start doing something new in astronomy you always find out things that you never expected and thats what I really look forward to.`,

//   `The international network of telescopes is known as the Low Frequency Array known as Lofar for short. Most of the antennas are located in Exloo in the Netherlands.`,

//   `Scientists have been documenting humans' difficulties coping with extreme heat for over a century. Much of that work, however, has taken place in laboratory settings to allow for a high degree of control.`,

//   `Research suggests that such perceptions can give way to actual violence when people lack an escape hatch. But this heat-aggression hypothesis has been hard to demonstrate outside the lab because teasing out the effect of heat from other environmental or biological variables linked to aggression is tricky in the messy real world. Studies in the last few years, however, have started confirming the idea.`,

//   `Scientists navigated a variety of quagmires to get to this stage. There's a whole host of physics issues that we've faced off and mitigated, Pak says. For example, researchers took pains to make the capsule absorb more energy, to eliminate tiny defects in the capsule and to carefully tune the laser pulses to maximize fusion.`,
